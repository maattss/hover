# Hover
This repository is used to develop our alternative game concept for our master thesis. Documentation technical specifications are found on the [Wiki-page](https://github.com/maattss/hover/wiki).

There is also another repository containing code for backend cloud functions which are used in the project: [Hover Functions](https://github.com/maattss/hover-functions).

## The concept
This concept is inspired by an existing application called [Hold](https://www.hold.app/). In short, players get points in Hold for not using their phone. Hover uses the same principle, but the points are awarded based on their location. Meaning the players get points when they are located at certain spots in the real world. The points can then later be used to receive rewards, such as discounts or free items.

The spots are based on locations that could improve a personâ€™s well-being, such as training centers, schools, libraries, museums, and art galleries. The locations are classified into four different categories corresponding to their purpose; health, knowledge, cultural and social. For example, training centers will be categorized as health, school as knowledge, museums and concert venues as culture, and bowling alleys and restaurants as social. The rewards and points will be summarized both for the individual categories and to a total score. In this way, the players can focus on doing their best in a specific category or try to get the best overall score.
