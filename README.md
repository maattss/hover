# Hover

This repository is used to develop our alternative game concept for our master thesis. Documentation technical specifications are found on the [Wiki-page](https://github.com/maattss/hover/wiki).

There is also another repository containing code for backend cloud functions which are used in the project: [Hover Functions](https://github.com/maattss/hover-functions).

## The concept

Hover is a pervasive game where your location is used as the input. In short, players get points for being at certain locations in the real world. The spots are based on places that could improve your well-being, such as training centers, schools, libraries, museums, and art galleries. They are classified into four different categories corresponding to their purpose; health, knowledge, cultural and social. For example, training centers will be categorized as health, school as knowledge, museums and concert venues as culture, and bowling alleys and restaurants as social.

Achievements and points are awarded based on individual categories and total score. In this way, you can focus on doing your best in a specific category or try to get the best overall score. Players can also challenge each other in pre-defined challenges where they decide the rules themselves
